<h1>Chapter 20: Security<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-20-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Internet can be a scary place.</p>
<p>These days, high-profile security gaffes seem to crop up on a daily basis. We’ve
seen viruses spread with amazing speed, swarms of compromised computers wielded as
weapons, a never-ending arms race against spammers, and many, many reports of
identify theft from hacked Web sites.</p>
<p>As Web developers, we have a duty to do what we can to combat these forces
of darkness. Every Web developer needs to treat security as a fundamental
aspect of Web programming. Unfortunately, it turns out that implementing security is <em>hard</em>
– attackers need to find only a single vulnerability, but defenders have to
protect every single one.</p>
<p>Django attempts to mitigate this difficulty. It’s designed to automatically
protect you from many of the common security mistakes that new (and even
experienced) Web developers make. Still, it’s important to understand what
these problems are, how Django protects you, and – most important – the
steps you can take to make your code even more secure.</p>
<p>First, though, an important disclaimer: We do not intend to present a
definitive guide to every known Web security exploit, and so we won’t try to
explain each vulnerability in a comprehensive manner. Instead, we’ll give a
short synopsis of security problems as they apply to Django.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-theme-of-web-security">
<h2>The Theme of Web Security<a class="headerlink" href="#the-theme-of-web-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you learn only one thing from this chapter, let it be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Never – under any circumstances – trust data from the browser.</div></blockquote>
<p>You <em>never</em> know who’s on the other side of that HTTP connection. It might be
one of your users, but it just as easily could be a nefarious cracker looking
for an opening.</p>
<p>Any data of any nature that comes from the browser needs to be treated with a
healthy dose of paranoia. This includes data that’s both “in band” (i.e.,
submitted from Web forms) and “out of band” (i.e., HTTP headers, cookies,
and other request information). It’s trivial to spoof the request metadata that
browsers usually add automatically.</p>
<p>Every one of the vulnerabilities discussed in this chapter stems directly from
trusting data that comes over the wire and then failing to sanitize that data
before using it. You should make it a general practice to continuously ask,
“Where does this data come from?”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sql-injection">
<h2>SQL Injection<a class="headerlink" href="#sql-injection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>SQL injection</em> is a common exploit in which an attacker alters Web page
parameters (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GET</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">POST</span></code> data or URLs) to insert arbitrary SQL
snippets that a naive Web application executes in its database directly. It’s
probably the most dangerous – and, unfortunately, one of the most common –
vulnerabilities out there.</p>
<p>This vulnerability most commonly crops up when constructing SQL “by hand” from
user input. For example, imagine writing a function to gather a list of
contact information from a contact search page. To prevent spammers from reading
every single e-mail in our system, we’ll force the user to type in someone’s
username before providing her e-mail address:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">user_contacts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;username&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;SELECT * FROM user_contacts WHERE username = &#39;</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">&#39;;&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">username</span>
    <span class="c1"># execute the SQL here...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In this example, and all similar “don’t do this” examples that follow,
we’ve deliberately left out most of the code needed to make the functions
actually work. We don’t want this code to work if someone accidentally
takes it out of context.</p>
</div>
<p>Though at first this doesn’t look dangerous, it really is.</p>
<p>First, our attempt at protecting our entire e-mail list will fail with a
cleverly constructed query. Think about what happens if an attacker types
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;'</span> <span class="pre">OR</span> <span class="pre">'a'='a&quot;</span></code> into the query box. In that case, the query that the string
interpolation will construct will be:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">FROM</span> <span class="n">user_contacts</span> <span class="n">WHERE</span> <span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> <span class="n">OR</span> <span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Because we allowed unsecured SQL into the string, the attacker’s added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OR</span></code>
clause ensures that every single row is returned.</p>
<p>However, that’s the <em>least</em> scary attack. Imagine what will happen if the
attacker submits <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;';</span> <span class="pre">DELETE</span> <span class="pre">FROM</span> <span class="pre">user_contacts</span> <span class="pre">WHERE</span> <span class="pre">'a'</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'a&quot;</span></code>. We’ll end
up with this complete query:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">FROM</span> <span class="n">user_contacts</span> <span class="n">WHERE</span> <span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">DELETE</span> <span class="n">FROM</span> <span class="n">user_contacts</span> <span class="n">WHERE</span> <span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Yikes! Our entire contact list would be deleted instantly.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-solution">
<h3>The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#the-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although this problem is insidious and sometimes hard to spot, the solution is
simple: <em>never</em> trust user-submitted data, and <em>always</em> escape it when passing
it into SQL.</p>
<p>The Django database API does this for you. It automatically escapes all
special SQL parameters, according to the quoting conventions of the database
server you’re using (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).</p>
<p>For example, in this API call:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar__exact</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;&#39; OR 1=1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Django will escape the input accordingly, resulting in a statement like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">FROM</span> <span class="n">foos</span> <span class="n">WHERE</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="se">\&#39;</span><span class="s1"> OR 1=1&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Completely harmless.</p>
<p>This applies to the entire Django database API, with a couple of exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">where</span></code> argument to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extra()</span></code> method. (See Appendix C.)
That parameter accepts raw SQL by design.</li>
<li>Queries done “by hand” using the lower-level database API. (See Chapter 10.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these cases, it’s easy to keep yourself protected. In each case,
avoid string interpolation in favor of passing in <em>bind parameters</em>. That is,
the example we started this section with should be written as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="n">connection</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">user_contacts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;username&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;SELECT * FROM user_contacts WHERE username = </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="c1"># ... do something with the results</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The low-level <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execute</span></code> method takes a SQL string with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%s</span></code> placeholders
and automatically escapes and inserts parameters from the list passed as the
second argument. You should <em>always</em> construct custom SQL this way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t use bind parameters everywhere in SQL; they’re not
allowed as identifiers (i.e., table or column names). Thus, if you need to,
say, dynamically construct a list of tables from a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">POST</span></code> variable, you’ll
need to escape that name in your code. Django provides a function,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">django.db.connection.ops.quote_name</span></code>, which will escape the identifier
according to the current database’s quoting scheme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cross-site-scripting-xss">
<h2>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-site-scripting-xss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Cross-site scripting</em> (XSS), is found in Web applications that fail to
escape user-submitted content properly before rendering it into HTML. This
allows an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML into your Web page, usually in the
form of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;script&gt;</span></code> tags.</p>
<p>Attackers often use XSS attacks to steal cookie and session information, or to trick
users into giving private information to the wrong person (aka <em>phishing</em>).</p>
<p>This type of attack can take a number of different forms and has almost
infinite permutations, so we’ll just look at a typical example. Consider this
extremely simple “Hello, World” view:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.http</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="n">HttpResponse</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GET</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;name&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;world&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">HttpResponse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s1">!&lt;/h1&gt;&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This view simply reads a name from a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GET</span></code> parameter and passes that name
into the generated HTML. So, if we accessed
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://example.com/hello/?name=Jacob</span></code>, the page would contain this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Jacob!&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But wait – what happens if we access
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://example.com/hello/?name=&lt;i&gt;Jacob&lt;/i&gt;</span></code>? Then we get this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, &lt;i&gt;Jacob&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, an attacker wouldn’t use something as benign as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;i&gt;</span></code> tags; he
could include a whole set of HTML that hijacked your page with arbitrary
content. This type of attack has been used to trick users into entering data
into what looks like their bank’s Web site, but in fact is an XSS-hijacked form
that submits their back account information to an attacker.</p>
<p>The problem gets worse if you store this data in the database and later display it
it on your site. For example, MySpace was once found to be vulnerable to an XSS
attack of this nature. A user inserted JavaScript into his profile that automatically
added him as your friend when you visited his profile page. Within a few days, he had
millions of friends.</p>
<p>Now, this may sound relatively benign, but keep in mind that this attacker
managed to get <em>his</em> code – not MySpace’s – running on <em>your</em> computer. This
violates the assumed trust that all the code on MySpace is actually written
by MySpace.</p>
<p>MySpace was extremely lucky that this malicious code didn’t automatically
delete viewers’ accounts, change their passwords, flood the site with spam, or
any of the other nightmare scenarios this vulnerability unleashes.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The solution is simple: <em>always</em> escape <em>any</em> content that might have come
from a user before inserting it into HTML.</p>
<p>To guard against this, Django’s template system automatically escapes all
variable values. Let’s see what happens if we rewrite our example using the
template system:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># views.py

from django.shortcuts import render

def say_hello(request):
    name = request.GET.get(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;world&#39;)
    return render(request, &#39;hello.html&#39;, {&#39;name&#39;: name})

# hello.html

&lt;h1&gt;Hello, {{ name }}!&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this in place, a request to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://example.com/hello/name=&lt;i&gt;Jacob&lt;/i&gt;</span></code>
will result in the following page:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Jacob&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We covered Django’s auto-escaping back in Chapter 4, along with ways to turn
it off. But even if you’re using this feature, you should <em>still</em> get in the
habit of asking yourself, at all times, “Where does this data come from?” No
automatic solution will ever protect your site from XSS attacks 100% of the
time.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="cross-site-request-forgery">
<h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-site-request-forgery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) happens when a malicious Web site tricks users
into unknowingly loading a URL from a site at which they’re already authenticated –
hence taking advantage of their authenticated status.</p>
<p>Django has built-in tools to protect from this kind of attack. Both the attack
itself and those tools are covered in great detail in <a class="reference external" href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="session-forging-hijacking">
<h2>Session Forging/Hijacking<a class="headerlink" href="#session-forging-hijacking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This isn’t a specific attack, but rather a general class of attacks on a
user’s session data. It can take a number of different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A <em>man-in-the-middle</em> attack, where an attacker snoops on session data
as it travels over the wire (or wireless) network.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Session forging</em>, where an attacker uses a session ID
(perhaps obtained through a man-in-the-middle attack) to pretend to be
another user.</p>
<p>An example of these first two would be an attacker in a coffee shop using
the shop’s wireless network to capture a session cookie. She could then use that
cookie to impersonate the original user.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A <em>cookie-forging</em> attack, where an attacker overrides the supposedly
read-only data stored in a cookie. <a class="reference external" href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> explains in detail how
cookies work, and one of the salient points is that it’s trivial for
browsers and malicious users to change cookies without your knowledge.</p>
<p>There’s a long history of Web sites that have stored a cookie like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IsLoggedIn=1</span></code> or even <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LoggedInAsUser=jacob</span></code>. It’s dead simple to
exploit these types of cookies.</p>
<p>On a more subtle level, though, it’s never a good idea to trust anything
stored in cookies. You never know who’s been poking at them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Session fixation</em>, where an attacker tricks a user into setting or
reseting the user’s session ID.</p>
<p>For example, PHP allows session identifiers to be passed in the URL
(e.g.,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://example.com/?PHPSESSID=fa90197ca25f6ab40bb1374c510d7a32</span></code>). An
attacker who tricks a user into clicking a link with a hard-coded
session ID will cause the user to pick up that session.</p>
<p>Session fixation has been used in phishing attacks to trick users into entering
personal information into an account the attacker owns. He can
later log into that account and retrieve the data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Session poisoning</em>, where an attacker injects potentially dangerous
data into a user’s session – usually through a Web form that the user
submits to set session data.</p>
<p>A canonical example is a site that stores a simple user preference (like
a page’s background color) in a cookie. An attacker could trick a user
into clicking a link to submit a “color” that actually contains an
XSS attack. If that color isn’t escaped, the user could again
inject malicious code into the user’s environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of general principles that can protect you from these attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Never allow session information to be contained in the URL.</p>
<p>Django’s session framework (see <a class="reference external" href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>) simply doesn’t allow
sessions to be contained in the URL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Don’t store data in cookies directly. Instead, store a session ID
that maps to session data stored on the backend.</p>
<p>If you use Django’s built-in session framework (i.e.,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">request.session</span></code>), this is handled automatically for you. The only
cookie that the session framework uses is a single session ID; all the
session data is stored in the database.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remember to escape session data if you display it in the template. See
the earlier XSS section, and remember that it applies to any user-created
content as well as any data from the browser. You should treat session
information as being user created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Prevent attackers from spoofing session IDs whenever possible.</p>
<p>Although it’s nearly impossible to detect someone who’s hijacked a
session ID, Django does have built-in protection against a brute-force
session attack. Session IDs are stored as hashes (instead of sequential
numbers), which prevents a brute-force attack, and a user will always get
a new session ID if she tries a nonexistent one, which prevents session
fixation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that none of those principles and tools prevents man-in-the-middle
attacks. These types of attacks are nearly impossible to detect. If your site
allows logged-in users to see any sort of sensitive data, you should <em>always</em>
serve that site over HTTPS. Additionally, if you have an SSL-enabled site,
you should set the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE</span></code> setting to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>; this will
make Django only send session cookies over HTTPS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="e-mail-header-injection">
<h2>E-mail Header Injection<a class="headerlink" href="#e-mail-header-injection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SQL injection’s less well-known sibling, <em>e-mail header injection</em>, hijacks
Web forms that send e-mail. An attacker can use this technique to send spam via
your mail server. Any form that constructs e-mail headers from Web form data is
vulnerable to this kind of attack.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the canonical contact form found on many sites. Usually this
sends a message to a hard-coded e-mail address and, hence, doesn’t appear
vulnerable to spam abuse at first glance.</p>
<p>However, most of these forms also allow the user to type in his own subject
for the e-mail (along with a “from” address, body, and sometimes a few other
fields). This subject field is used to construct the “subject” header of the
e-mail message.</p>
<p>If that header is unescaped when building the e-mail message, an attacker could
submit something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;hello\ncc:spamvictim&#64;example.com&quot;</span></code> (where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;\n</span></code>” is
a newline character). That would make the constructed e-mail headers turn into:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">To</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">hardcoded</span><span class="nd">@example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">Subject</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">hello</span>
<span class="n">cc</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">spamvictim</span><span class="nd">@example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Like SQL injection, if we trust the subject line given by the user, we’ll
allow him to construct a malicious set of headers, and he can use our
contact form to send spam.</p>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3>The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We can prevent this attack in the same way we prevent SQL injection: always
escape or validate user-submitted content.</p>
<p>Django’s built-in mail functions (in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">django.core.mail</span></code>) simply do not allow
newlines in any fields used to construct headers (the from and to addresses,
plus the subject). If you try to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">django.core.mail.send_mail</span></code> with a
subject that contains newlines, Django will raise a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BadHeaderError</span></code>
exception.</p>
<p>If you do not use Django’s built-in mail functions to send e-mail, you’ll need
to make sure that newlines in headers either cause an error or are stripped.
You may want to examine the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SafeMIMEText</span></code> class in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">django.core.mail</span></code> to

<h2>Directory Traversal<a class="headerlink" href="#directory-traversal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Directory traversal</em> is another injection-style attack, wherein a malicious
user tricks filesystem code into reading and/or writing files that the Web
server shouldn’t have access to.</p>
<p>An example might be a view that reads files from the disk without carefully
sanitizing the file name:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dump_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;filename&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BASE_PATH</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Though it looks like that view restricts file access to files beneath
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BASE_PATH</span></code> (by using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os.path.join</span></code>), if the attacker passes in a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filename</span></code> containing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">..</span></code> (that’s two periods, a shorthand for
“the parent directory”), she can access files “above” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BASE_PATH</span></code>. It’s only
a matter of time before she can discover the correct number of dots to
successfully access, say, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">../../../../../etc/passwd</span></code>.</p>
<p>Anything that reads files without proper escaping is vulnerable to this
problem. Views that <em>write</em> files are just as vulnerable, but the consequences
are doubly dire.</p>
<p>Another permutation of this problem lies in code that dynamically loads
modules based on the URL or other request information. A well-publicized
example came from the world of Ruby on Rails.  Prior to mid-2006,
Rails used URLs like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://example.com/person/poke/1</span></code> directly to
load modules and call methods. The result was that a
carefully constructed URL could automatically load arbitrary code,
including a database reset script!</p>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h3>The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If your code ever needs to read or write files based on user input, you need
to sanitize the requested path very carefully to ensure that an attacker isn’t
able to escape from the base directory you’re restricting access to.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Needless to say, you should <em>never</em> write code that can read from any
area of the disk!</p>
</div>
<p>A good example of how to do this escaping lies in Django’s built-in static
content-serving view (in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">django.views.static</span></code>). Here’s the relevant code:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">posixpath</span>

<p>Django doesn’t read files (unless you use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">static.serve</span></code>
function, but that’s protected with the code just shown), so this
vulnerability doesn’t affect the core code much.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of the URLconf abstraction means that Django will <em>never</em>
load code you’ve not explicitly told it to load. There’s no way to create a
URL that causes Django to load something not mentioned in a URLconf.</p>

<div class="section" id="exposed-error-messages">
<h2>Exposed Error Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#exposed-error-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During development, being able to see tracebacks and errors live in your
browser is extremely useful. Django has “pretty” and informative debug
messages specifically to make debugging easier.</p>
<p>However, if these errors get displayed once the site goes live, they can
reveal aspects of your code or configuration that could aid an attacker.</p>
<p>Furthermore, errors and tracebacks aren’t at all useful to end users. Django’s
philosophy is that site visitors should never see application-related error
messages. If your code raises an unhandled exception, a site visitor should
not see the full traceback – or <em>any</em> hint of code snippets or Python
(programmer-oriented) error messages. Instead, the visitor should see a
friendly “This page is unavailable” message.</p>
<p>Naturally, of course, developers need to see tracebacks to debug problems in
their code. So the framework should hide all error messages from the public,
but it should display them to the trusted site developers.</p>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h3>The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As we covered in Chapter 12, Django’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> setting controls the display of
these error messages. Make sure to set this to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code> when you’re ready to
deploy.</p>
<p>Users deploying under Apache and mod_python (also see Chapter 12) should also
make sure they have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PythonDebug</span> <span class="pre">Off</span></code> in their Apache conf files; this will
suppress any errors that occur before Django has had a chance to load.</p>

<h2>A Final Word on Security<a class="headerlink" href="#a-final-word-on-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We hope all this talk of security problems isn’t too intimidating. It’s true
that the Web can be a wild world, but with a little bit of foresight,
you can have a secure Web site.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Web security is a constantly changing field; if you’re
reading the dead-tree version of this book, be sure to check more up to date
security resources for any new vulnerabilities that have been discovered. In
fact, it’s always a good idea to spend some time each week or month
researching and keeping current on the state of Web application security. It’s
a small investment to make, but the protection you’ll get for your site and
your users is priceless.</p>
