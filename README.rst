===============
The Django Book
===============

Welcome to the community edition of the Django Book!

This book was originally published by Apress in 2009 and covered Django version 1.0. Then it is maintained by <http://github.com/jacobian/djangobook.com/>. Since then it has languished and, in places, is **extremely out of date**. We are working on getting the book updated to cover Django versions 1.6, 1.7 and beyond. But we need your help, we’re making this book — warts and all — `open source`__ in the hopes that it will find love as a community project.

So, if you’d like to help out, `hop on over to GitHub`__ and send us a pull request!
